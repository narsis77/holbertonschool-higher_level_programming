1. lookup: return a list of an object's members and attributes
2. my_list: list class, but with an extra print_sorted method
3. is_same_class: check whether object is exactly a particular class
4. is_kind_of_class: check whether object is or is a subclass of a class
5. inherits_from: check whether object is a subclass of a class
6. 5-base_geometry: empty base geometry class
7. 6-base_geometry: add base area handler
8. 7-base_geometry: add method that validates string is an integer > 0
9. 8-rectangle: subclass of base_geometry, init with width/height
10. 9-rectangle: implement area and print methods
11. 10-square: inherit from rectangle to make a square
12. 11-square: implement square specific print method
13. my_int: inherit from int class, reverse == and !=
